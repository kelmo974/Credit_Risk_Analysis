# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Using machine learning to identify good loan candidates for FinTech firms


## Purpose
This endevor was meant to be an overiview of various machine learning alogrithms that use slightly differing approaches to solve the same problem. The problem, in this case, deals with lending by FinTech organizations. Would one algorithm produce more telling results than the others or, perhaps, a clear confidence factor would become known. This would allow for assigning each algorithm a unique degree of value with respecct to how much trust can be given to its quantitative results. 

## Methods
In total, six machine learning algorithms were applied to the 2019 Q1 Loan dataset. Those included:

 1. SMOTE Oversampling 
 2. Naive Random Oversampling
 3. Undersampling
 4. Combination Sampling
 5. Balanced Random Forest Classifier
 6. Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier



## Results
Results for each algorithm are as follows:

Naive Random Oversampling
SMOTE Oversampling 
Undersampling
Combination Sampling
Balanced Random Forest Classifier
Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier


## Conclusion
Summary
The results of this project could allow one to surmise that the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier machine learning model was the most favorable. This is because the balanced score was 0.93, High Risk pre score was 0.09, High Risk rec score was 0.92, Low Risk pre score was 1.00, and the Low Risk rec score was 0.94. All scores were the highest for this model than any other machine learning model in this project making it the best at accurately gathering positive values in the data set.
